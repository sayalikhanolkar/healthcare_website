                <h3>Origin of Yoga</h3>
                <p>Yoga originated in ancient India over 5,000 years ago as a spiritual practice. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit "yuj," meaning to unite. It was first mentioned in the Rigveda and later systematized by Patanjali in the Yoga Sutras. Originally focused on spiritual development, it evolved to include physical postures and breathing techniques. Yoga gained global popularity in the 20th century, blending physical, mental, and spiritual practices.</p>
